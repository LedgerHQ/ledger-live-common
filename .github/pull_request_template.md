## Context (issues, jira)



## Description / Usage

<!-- please share a sample of code that uses your new code (if features were added) -->
<!-- please document quickly what would the "user land" need to do to use the feature -->

## Expectations

- [ ] **Test coverage: The changes of this PR are covered by test.** Unit test were added with mocks when depending on a backend/device.
- [ ] **No impact: The changes of this PR have ZERO impact on the userland.** Meaning, we can use these changes without modifying LLD/LLM at all. It will be a "noop" and the maintainers will be able to bump it without changing anything.

<!--
If one of these can't be checked, please document it carefully (on the reason you can't check it).
NB: We want to avoid as much as possible such breaking changes to make a bump very easy.
