### `cli/` folder: a `ledger-live` command-line version

> If you are a developer and need to work with latest version, [see this documentation instead](dev-with-cli.md) (typically if you want to test local changes).

**Ledger Live Common** exposes a command line tool (CLI) that can be used to test Ledger Live features in a terminal.

To install it, you will need to have an instance of [Node 12 (LTS)](https://nodejs.org/en/).

You can then install it with

```
npm i -g ledger-live
```

You can now run:

```
ledger-live
```
